            <p>Had an office tour here a few years ago and absolutely loved the look of it , as an AV person I was very impressed with the meeting rooms and loved the themes. Most of the staff were generally friendly and I was offered a range of different waters when waiting at reception.The office is beautifully designed, onsite chef cooked a pretty alright lunch, staff interviewing as well were quite friendly and knew to be precise for technical interviews. I’d like to come back again one day for another tour just to see how it’s all going :)</p>
